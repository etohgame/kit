# Tower Submission Rules

This page contains the rules you must follow when building and submitting towers for EToH.

Once your tower is submitted, it will be reviewed by a curator, who will provide feedback and suggestions for improvement, and will give the verdict on it passing. If your tower fails to pass, you must wait 3 days before resubmission. You can ask our curation team if you have any questions or advice regarding the guidelines or your tower via DM's or mentioning them.

Ensure Dyno on Discord can message you as we use it to alert users of deleted submissions.

## What to include in your submission

* The tower's name
* Link to the tower place. Must be a standalone place, do not use places like hubs.
* The difficulty you think is applicable.
* Part count of the tower, including the frame and all parts in the `Obby` folder. Note that all parts (excluding NegativeParts) that comprise an union also count towards the limit.
* Optionally, include a video or other notes that you think would be helpful.

## Tower Place

* Your place must include the `Noclip` and `Heal` tools that are included by default in the kit. We also recommend adding a godmode tool if your tower heavily relies on killbricks, especially instakills
* Your place must include the modified `PlayerModule` script included in the kit.
* Your tower should be easily enterable when joining the place.
* Upload your tower's intended music and include the audio in the place using the provided music module. Refer to [the music system documentation](music-system.md) for help in adding music and [this guide](https://discord.com/channels/551741409624064011/628681282565570590/1373382166448439507) if you are having trouble getting the audio past moderation
* You may include terrain or other decoration in the tower’s place if you wish, but ensure it does not interfere with gameplay and please be aware that the terrain may not be included ingame.
* The tower place must be public and accessible to everybody, including no paid access fees or age restrictions.

## Tower Building

* Towers must be built in Roblox Studio, using the official kit only. Your tower must be built with the latest available version of the kit, unless it was started before the release of said version.
* The tower floor count must be within the range of the tower type being built. Towers are 10 floors, Steeples are 5-6, and Citadels are 12-25.
    * A “floor” is generally defined as a 100x100x100 box with clear boundaries. Floors may be moved or rotated into orientations that differ from the default frame in the kit, and may be expanded up to 75 studs to the side in any direction. There is no limit on how far “outside sections” may extend from the tower’s frame, and enclosed spaces significantly smaller than a floor in at least one dimension (i.e. droppers or small basements) are not considered floors.
    * We still suggest that you aim to make your tower feel like a tower and ensure that floors are clearly distinguishable and taken into consideration in the tower’s progression, as this will increase your chances of approval.
    * Your tower must have a presentable frame that contains at least a portion of the gameplay. Towers without a visible frame or towers that have nothing resembling a frame are not allowed. A "fake" frame may be used in place of the actual frame as long as it contains at least a portion of the tower's gameplay.

* Your tower must not have more than 7500 server-sided (obby + frame) parts. Citadels may use 750 additional parts per extra floor. Do not place static parts in the client object folder to circumvent this requirement; this includes making parts button-activated if there is no direct purpose for gameplay.
* No free models should be in your tower.
* For performance reasons, it's recommended to use meshes, textures, unusual materials, etc. sparingly.

* Custom scripts, or CCO's (Custom Client Objects) cannot be used unless you have the Verified Builder role or are in a collab with someone who has the role.
    * Minor edits are allowed as long as they do not change the core functionality of an object, including making heavy edits to repository scripts in the kit. “Heavy” edits are defined as the addition of new lines or major changes to existing lines in a script; changes to number values, etc. are fine.
    * Script edits that are not blatantly noticeable are usually allowed, for example: edits made to bugfix complex contraptions. If client object contraptions are difficult to explain without script edits, we may inquire to explain what you did and likely request to replace certain sections if there is a problem. Feel free to reach out to curators while building towers to ask if certain edits are acceptable.
    * Do not edit any existing scripts. These changes will not carry over ingame and will cause issues. If you wish to write a custom script or make minor script edits to an existing object, please read [the guidelines on them](misc.md#writingediting-repository-scripts) to avoid issues.
    * Custom scripts that affect lighting (without using the built-in `LightingManager`) are entirely disallowed.
* No AI Generated content whatsoever.

## Tower Submission

* You may only submit a tower three times in total unless it is given a major revamp. (i.e. the majority of the tower’s gameplay has been replaced)
* Be cautious with resubmitting passing towers, as a failing verdict will result in your tower being removed from the whitelist.
* Provide credit to all users who built at least 10% of the tower’s total gameplay, unless they wish to not be credited.
* Do not submit towers specifically with the intent of becoming a monthly.
* Steeple submissions are only allowed if at least one of the following is applicable:
    * Steeple submissions for an unreleased area are open
    * There is an ongoing contest
* Citadel submissions are only allowed if you meet at least one of the following requirements:
    * You have the Verified Builder role or are in a collab with someone who has the role
    * You have at least one tower ingame with 2 or fewer builders credited (including monthly towers)
* Do not repost submissions. Please be patient as we work on our own time.
* Do not submit joke/low effort/old towers without the intent of it passing.
* By submitting your tower, you agree to give us the rights to your tower. Should it get ingame, you are no longer allowed to request its removal from the game.

## Naming

* Tower names must begin with "[Tower/Citadel/Steeple] of" before the name and must be between 1 and 4 words long ("Tower of ___ ___ ___ ___").
* The tower name and acronym must not match with another tower in-game (excluding monthly towers) and be appropriate.
