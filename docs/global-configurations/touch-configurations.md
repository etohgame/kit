# TouchConfiguration

All client objects that can be interacted with have a `TouchConfiguration` configuration object parented inside of their regular configuration. This object holds extra settings relating to what objects are allowed to interact with the client object.

| `player` | true | When true, the client object can be interacted with by the player.
| `pushbox` | true | When true, the client object can be interacted with by [Pushboxes](/docs/client-objects/pushbox-spawners.md).
