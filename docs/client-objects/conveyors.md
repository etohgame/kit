# Conveyors

Conveyors are parts that move objects in the direction they are facing.

## Use Cases

Conveyors are useful for quickly moving objects to different places, for example during gameplay or in [Pushbox contraptions](pushbox-spawners.md). They can also be used as obstacles the player has to avoid.
