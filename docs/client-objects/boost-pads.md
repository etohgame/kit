# Boost Pads

Boost Pads are similar to [Boosters](boosters.md), but the boost is only active while the player is interacting with or near the boost pad.

## Use Cases
Boost Pads can be used to have a Boost only be active when the player is interacting with the Boost Pad. Boost Pads will instantly end their effect when deactivated rather than having it slowly fade over time.

## Configuration

For the Type and Power settings, see [Boosters](boosters.md)
