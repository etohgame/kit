# One-Way Platforms

One-way platforms are parts that are only solid from one side. When the player is on the other side of the part, it will not be collidable.

## Use Cases

One-way platforms are useful for making mechanics such as platforms that you can jump through from the bottom, or trapdoors that the player can fall through but not jump back up onto.
