# Vanishers

Vanishers are objects that allow any BasePart to vanish.

## Use Cases

Vanishers can be used to create varying types of gameplay, puzzles, or contraptions.

## Vanish modes

Each `VanishMode` has unique logic.

| Mode |  Description
|:-----:|:-----:
| `Fade` | Smoothly fades.
| `Blink` | Flashes multiple times before vanishing.
| `Constant` | Gradually fades depending on contact. If not in contact, regenerates.
