# Moving Platforms

Moving Platforms are parts that will periodically move between set destinations.

## Use Cases
Moving Platforms can be used to transport players and objects between various locations. They can also rotate if the destinations are rotated.

## Moving Platform Configuration
| Name | Default Value | Description
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
| `TouchActivated` | false | When true, the platform will not start moving until it is interacted with. Useful for not making the player wait around too long.
| `Tween` | false | When true, the platform will move using the [TweenConfiguration](/docs/global-configurations/tween-configurations.md) found in each destination part instead of moving with the default speed. It will still carry objects. Please note that when this is enabled, the `Reponsiveness` on both the `AlignPosition` and `AlignOrientation` objects must be increased in order to have it function properly.

## Destination Configuration
| Name | Default Value | Description
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
| `MoveDelay` | 2 | How long the moving platform will stay at this destination before moving onto the next.
