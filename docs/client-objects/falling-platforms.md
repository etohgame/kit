# Falling Platforms

Falling Platforms are platforms that will fall when stepped on. Once it touches the `End` part, it will become uncollidable until it's back at its original position.

## Use Cases

Falling Platforms can be used for advanced gameplay mechanics or to force the player not to wait around on certain sections. It is heavily recommended not to use them as traps as it can create frustrating and unfair gameplay.
